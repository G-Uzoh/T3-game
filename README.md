# Tic Tac Toe Game

- This project builds a tic tac toe game in vanilla JavaScript and migrates the app to TypeScript and React. The original project was created by Meg and Ivan (Twitter handles @megfdev and @Ivan00sto) and refactored by Zach Gollwitzer (Twitter handle @zg_dev).

- I am using this as a learning material and might tweak a few things.

## What I want to learn

- Intermediate to advanced JavaScript concepts and terminologies such as critical rendering path, model view controller (MVC), classes, namespace, etc. and their application in real projects.
